In this project, I have implement MRF Tyre Stock Price Prediction with a Machine Learning technique. We use the Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) method to create a Machine Learning model to forecast MRF stock values. They are used to make minor changes to the information by multiplying and adding. Long-term memory (LSTM) is a deep learning artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture.
We also use TensorFlow, an Open-Source Python Machine Learning Framework developed by Google. TensorFlow makes it easy to implement Time Series forecasting data. Since Stock Price Prediction is one of the Time Series Forecasting problems, we will build an end-to-end MRF Tyre Stock Price Prediction with a Machine learning technique.
Stock price analysis has been a critical area of research and is one of the top applications of machine learning. Here, you will use an LSTM network to train your model with MRF Tyre stocks data from 30-08-2018 to 30-08-2023.
A stock market is a public market where you can buy and sell shares for publicly listed companies. The stocks, also known as equities, represent ownership in the company. The stock exchange is the mediator that allows the buying and selling of shares. 

#### Stock Price Prediction
Stock Price Prediction using machine learning helps you discover the future value of company stock and other financial assets traded on an exchange. The entire idea of predicting stock prices is to gain significant profits. Predicting how the stock market will perform is a hard task to do. There are other factors involved in the prediction, such as physical and psychological factors, rational and irrational behavior, and so on. All these factors combine to make share prices dynamic and volatile. This makes it very difficult to predict stock prices with high accuracy. 

The dataset we will use here to perform the analysis and build a predictive model is MRF Limited Stock Price data. We will use OHLC (‘Open’, ‘High’, ‘Low’, ‘Close’) data from 30st August 2018 to 30st August 2023 which is for 5 years for the MRF Limited stocks.
